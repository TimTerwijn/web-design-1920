### Progress
This project is divided in multiple cycles. Each cycle contains three phases which are called together Think, Make and check.

#### Week 1
##### Think
For the first think phase I thought about the problems Marie has. She is Deaf so I assume she has problems listening to things on the web and also to understand certain behavior of people that can listen to sound. I think I am able to fix her problem by making website with an Iframe where she can browse websites and when some audio is played it appears on her screen. I want to make use of gifs/images to show Marie the things she does not understand with certain words (the fun part of my project).

##### Make
Before the interview I made a small demo that I can present my idea to Marie.
![prototype1](/docs/img/prototype1.png)

##### Check

After that I showed my demo to Marie but it was quite the challenge to show my work and talk at the same time, because Marie could not look at my emotions, look at the translator and see my work. So for the next time I want to talk first and show my demo thereafter in small chunks.

![demo](/docs/img/demo1.png)

This is the feedback I had received from Marie:
* She did not like the idea of a screen in a screen (Iframe), she would like to have use her browser for browsing and use my application in the background. My solution for this is to make the application mobile first so that Marie can look at her phone during a podcast (or any sound at all.).

* Marie doesn't know when her computer is supposed to make any sound that's why I narrow the use case of this application down to only the podcast. That does not mean that she can use the application for anything else tho. If I have some time left for this project I could have the phone vibrating once or showing some light when sound is playing. But that's out of the scope for now.

* If multiple people are talking during the podcast (or something else). It is maybe hard to understand who is talking at the moment.I have to test this to figure out if this is the case, and think of a solution.

##### Think
Marie told us today that Deaf people have their own culture and are not speaking exactly the same languages as Dutch people. They use fewer words to make something clear to each other and I think that is pretty cool and it also blew my mind a bit.

It made me also think about my fun part. If Marie and other Deaf people prefer images and sign language over regular text. It would be cool to replace the subjects and maybe other parts of a sentence with images and/or an image of sign language.

##### Make
I made a simple application with a speech to text functionality to test if my project is doable. I found out that the application could indeed record some simple words. But it was impossible to record large texts because it took a long wile before it shows anything and after it shows something it was only a small part of the whole sentence.

#### Week 2
##### Think
Because last week did not work out, I had to change my idea. So this week I started with a brand new idea. I want to work the podcast out even more. So here is my 4 step plan for the next week.

* First of all, I need to pick a podcast that Marie likes.
* Secondly I need to translate the podcast to sign language gifs and apply images of objects where possible.
* Then I need to show those gifs and images inside an application one at a time to transfer the message of the podcast to Marie.
* Lastly I need to make it fun to use, so I want to add fun transitions between gifs and images.

So it would look a bit like this:  
![voorbeeld1](/docs/img/voorbeeld/kom.gif)  
![voorbeeld2](/docs/img/voorbeeld/jij.gif)  
![voorbeeld3](/docs/img/voorbeeld/naar.gif)  
![voorbeeld4](/docs/img/voorbeeld/boom.png)  

##### Make
However, before I can do anything of the above plan I need to be sure if Marie likes my idea. I have to show my idea and talk about my 4 step plan and use the above image for that. I also have to make a prototype which you can see in the next image.

![demo2](/docs/img/demo2.png)

##### Check
I showed my second prototype to Marie, but sadly Marie did not like my idea at all. She thought it would be a step back from my previous plan. (Which is correct.) And she also felt a bit insulted because the app was perfect for Deaf people who also have a learning disorder but because this has to be an app for Marie, it is not a useful app for her. So I have to go back to the drawing board.

![demo22](/docs/img/demo22.png)

##### Think
If I want to deliver a usable prototype for Marie, with only one feedback session left, I really need to play safe now. And I have to start working on it as soon as possible. I would be wise to use feedback other students received from Marie to make my own simple (but fun) Podcast application. For me this is the best chance I have to show something useful to Marie next week.

That is why I am going to work on a simple Podcast application with the help of the feedback that other students received. (I wrote them down as well.)

##### Make

After that, I started working on a prototype. I know now that Marie preferred text over images and sign language, so I made another prototype. This time I want to show some sort of cartoon where the story is text based and one person talks (visible) and the other person is shown listening and thinking. The user of the application can see the conversation, the emotions and the thinking (in images) during the conversation.

![prototype3](/docs/img/prototype3.png)

Some features I would like to implement are:
* When someone talks, their lips are talking animated in a funny way.
* The speaker his story is written in text inside a text bubble.
* I want to show the emotions of the speaker with colours, fonts, bolt and italic. The meaning of that emotion will be explained.
* The lips of the listener are silenced.
* You can see the thinking of the listener.
