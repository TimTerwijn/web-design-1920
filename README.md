### Progress book
This project is divided in multiple cycles. Each cylce contains three phases which are called togeter Think, Make and check.

#### Week 1
##### Think
For the first think phase I thought about the problems Marie has. She is Deaf so i assume she has problems listening to things on the web and also to understand certain behavior of people that can listen to sound. I think I am able to fix her problem by making website with a iframe where she can browse websites and when some audio is played it apears on her screen. I want to make use of gifs/images to show Marie the things she does not understand with certain words (the fun part of my project).

##### Make
Before the interview I made a small demo that I can present my idea to Marie.

##### Check

After that I showed my demo to Marie but it was quite the challange to show my work and talk at the same time, because Marie could not look at my emotions, look at the translator and see my work. So for the next time I want to talk first and show my demo there after in small chunks.

This is the feedback I had received from Maried: 
* She did not like the idea of an screen in a screen (iframe), she would like to have use her browser for browsing and use my application in the background. My solution for this is to make the application mobile first so that marie can look at her phone during a potcast (or any sound at all.).

* Marie doesn't know when her computer is suposed to make any sound thats why I narrow the usecase of this application down to only the podcast. That does not mean that she can use the application for anything else tho. If I have some time left for this project I could have the phone viberating once or showing some light when sound is playing. But thats out of the scope for mow.

* If multiple people are talkink during the podcast (or something else). It is maybe hard to understand who is talking at the moment.I have to test this to figure out if this is the case, and think of a solution.

##### Think
Marie told us today that Deaf people have their own culture and are not speaking exactly the same languages as Dutch people. They use less words to make something clear to eachother and I think that is pretty cool and it alsow blew my mind a bit. 

It made me think about my fun part
