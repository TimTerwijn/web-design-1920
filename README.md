### Progress
This project is divided in multiple cycles. Each cycle contains three phases which are called together Think, Make and check.

#### Week 1
##### Think
For the first think phase I thought about the problems Marie has. She is Deaf so I assume she has problems listening to things on the web and also to understand certain behavior of people that can listen to sound. I think I am able to fix her problem by making website with an Iframe where she can browse websites and when some audio is played it appears on her screen. I want to make use of gifs/images to show Marie the things she does not understand with certain words (the fun part of my project).

##### Make
Before the interview I made a small demo that I can present my idea to Marie.

##### Check

After that I showed my demo to Marie but it was quite the challenge to show my work and talk at the same time, because Marie could not look at my emotions, look at the translator and see my work. So for the next time I want to talk first and show my demo thereafter in small chunks.

This is the feedback I had received from Marie:
* She did not like the idea of a screen in a screen (Iframe), she would like to have use her browser for browsing and use my application in the background. My solution for this is to make the application mobile first so that Marie can look at her phone during a podcast (or any sound at all.).

* Marie doesn't know when her computer is supposed to make any sound that's why I narrow the use case of this application down to only the podcast. That does not mean that she can use the application for anything else tho. If I have some time left for this project I could have the phone vibrating once or showing some light when sound is playing. But that's out of the scope for now.

* If multiple people are talking during the podcast (or something else). It is maybe hard to understand who is talking at the moment.I have to test this to figure out if this is the case, and think of a solution.

##### Think
Marie told us today that Deaf people have their own culture and are not speaking exactly the same languages as Dutch people. They use fewer words to make something clear to each other and I think that is pretty cool and it also blew my mind a bit.

It made me also think about my fun part. If Marie and other Deaf people prefer images and sign language over regular text. It would be cool to replace the subjects and maybe other parts of a sentence with images and/or an image of sign language.
