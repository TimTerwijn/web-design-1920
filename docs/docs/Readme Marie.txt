This project is devided into three phases togehther in a cycle. 

Think: During the think phase, you think about what you are going to make or chance.
Make: During the make phase, you are makeing something for someone.
Check: During the check phase, you check the things you made with the person you are making it for.

THINK #1
For the first think phase I thought about the problems Marie has. She is Deaf so she has problems listening to things on the web
and also to understand ceirtain behaviour of people that can listen to sound. I think I can fix her problem by making a browser in
a browser and some kind of way to listen to the audio that the internal browser makes and show those words to the user. To make
Marie understand the behavour of other people I want to make use of gifs/images that show up during ceirtain words (the fun part).

MAKE #1
Before the interview I made a small demo that I can present my Idea to Marie.
